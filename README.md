# Snake - My interpretation of the classic Snake game 
Introduced by the Nokia 6110 in 1997, Snake is a classic retro game where you are a snake who must eat food to grow larger. I wrote the game to get better at OOP (Object-Oriented-programming) and to get a feel as to what to excpect from bigger projects. I also made multiple menus in the game where you can do diffrent actions by clicking buttons on the screen whom I have all my myself (including the images for the buttons). I have already finished this project at the time of making this repository so I made this repository solely for the purpse of showingo off my game.
