# Snake-game
My interpretation of the classic Snake game introduced by the Nokia 6110 in 1997.

# Menu
You are brought to a menu where you can start the game.
The choices are: Quit, which exits the game immediately; AI and Rules, which are to be continued; Start, Which brings you to the next section of the game. As well as a little sound button at the bottem left used to turn the game volume on and off.

# Speed
You must choose a speed for the snake to move i.e. the FPS
The choices are: Snail (7 FPS), Medium (10 FPS), and last but not least Speedy (13 FPS). Once a speed is chosen you are brought to the next section of the game. Or you can go back to the previous menu.

# Game
You start as a single square on a large grid. You must eat the red food squares to grow larger. Occasionally a green food square will apear which will grow you snake many times larger than a red food square The snake cannot hit walls nor hit itself or the you lose. 

# Lose
After losing a little box will pop up telling you Your Score, your High Score, to Go Back, or to Play Again.
Going back allows you to chose a new speed and playing again starts a new game with the same speed.
