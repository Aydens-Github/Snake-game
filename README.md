# Snake-game
My interpretation of the classic Snake game introduced by the Nokia 6110 in 1997

# Menu
You are brought to a menu where you can start the game.

# Speed
You must choose a speed for the snake to move i.e. the FPS
The choices are:

Snail (7 FPS)

Medium (10 FPS)

Speedy (13 FPS

# Game
You start as a single square on a large grid. You must eat the red food squares to grow larger. Occasionally a green food square will apear which will grow you snake many times larger than a red food square The snake cannot hit walls nor hit itself or the you lose.
