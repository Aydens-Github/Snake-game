# Snake - My interpretation of the classic Snake game 
Introduced by the Nokia 6110 in 1997, Snake is a classic retro game where you are a snake who must eat food to grow larger. I wrote the game to get better at OOP (Object-Oriented-programming) and to get a feel as to what to excpect from bigger projects. I also made multiple menus in the game where you can do diffrent actions by clicking buttons on the screen whom I have all my myself (including the images for the buttons). I have already finished this project at the time of making this repository so I made this repository solely for the purpse of showingo off my game.

# Installation
This game was made in python `3.10` but im sure other versions work as well cause its not that complicated. In a [virtual environment](https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv) pip install [pygame](https://github.com/pygame/):
```bash
pip install pygame
```
Like i said, not that complicated.

# PS
The game isnt really finished the Rules button in the menu has no function, the AI button neither and I don't plan on finishing them any time soon.

# PPS 
This is my first github repository im very new to github so sorry if my readme is jumbled and all over the place im still learning.
